VAE- to reduce space of an a HD image- application of an autoencoder.
can change the bg of an image or create a new bg based on all the bgs

The encoder captures the essence of th eimage and then decoder recreates while reducing the size.

Deepfakes - result of GANs

RNN - > LSTM (long short term memory) -> GRUs (Gated recurrent units)

Encoder- is responsible to understand the textual data

The Lion is ----------

King
Leader

The decoder then along with softmax, will decide, that The Lion is King. using LSTMs
it was updated with Transformer with Attention (its deprecated now)

with genAI these models are redundant.

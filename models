#GAN (generative adversarial networks)
1) Discriminator- classify data. dummy vs real
2) Generator- generates synthetic data

RNN (Recurrent neural networks)
-Variational
- process sequential data
- works on the principle of _ts
- will forget the context

ANN (Artificial neural networks)

#Autoencoders- type of neural network
used for image geneartion, anomaly detection
